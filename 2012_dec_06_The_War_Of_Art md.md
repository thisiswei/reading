> some years ago I was as blocked as a calcutta sewer

> how many pages have i produced? I don't care. Are they any good? I don't even think about it. All the matter is I've put
in my time and hit it with all I've got.All the count is that,for this day,for this session,I have overcome Resistance


> There's a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don't,and the secret is this: It's not the writing part is
hard.What's hard is sitting down to write.

> Most of us have two lives.The life we live,and the unlived life within us.

> Resistance is the most toxic force on the planet. It is the root of more unhappiness than poverty,disease,and erectile
dysfunction


----
> Is that what it takes? Do we have to stare death in the face to make us stand up and confront Resistance?


> It was easier for Hilter to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas.


> Any activity whose aim is tighter abdominals.  In other words,any act that reject immediate gratification in favor of
long-term growth,health,or integrity. Or, expressed another way, any act that derives from our higher nature instead of
our lower.Any of these will elicit Resistance.


> Rule of thumb:The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution,the more resistance we will feel toward
pursuing it.

> Henry Fonda was still throwing up before each stage performance,even when he was seventy-five.In other words,fear
dosen't go away.The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity,which dictates that the battle must be
fought anew every day.

> Resistance's goal is not to wound or disable.Resistance aims to kill. Its target is the epicenter of our being:our
genius,our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on earth to give and that no one else has but us.Resistance
means business.When we fight it,we are in war to the death.

> Resistance has no strength of its own.Evey ounce of juice it possesses comes from us.We feed it with power by our fear
of it.Master that fear and we conquer Resistance.

> The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight.At this point,Resistance knows we're about to beat it. It hits
the panic button.It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it's got.

----
> The highest treason a crab can commit is to make a leap for the rim of the bucket.

> The best thing you can do for that friend(and he'd tell you this himself,if he really is you friend) is to get over the
wall and keep motating.

> The best and only thing that one artist can do for another is to serve as an example and an inspiration.

> Procrastination is the most common manifestation of resistance because it's the easist to rationlize.We don't tell
ourselves,"I'm never going to write my symphony." Instead we say,"I'm just going to start tomorrow...."

> The most pernicious aspect of procrastination is that it can become a habit.We don't just put off our lives today;we put
them off till our deathbed.

> Sometimes resistance takes the form of sex,or an obsessive preoccupation with sex. Why sex? Because sex provides
immediate and powerful gratification.When someone sleeps with us,we feel validated and approved of, even
loved.Resistance gets a big kick out of that.It knows it has distracted us with a cheap,easy fix and kept us from doing
our work.

> We get ourselves in trouble because it's cheap way to get attention.

> Creating soup opera in our lives is a symptom of resistance. Why put in years of work designing a new software interface
when you can get just as much attention by bringing home a boyfriend with a prison record.

Our boss used to tell us: Invent a disease.Come up with the disease,he said,and we can sell the cure.

> We're doing exatly what TV commercials and pop materialist culture have been brainwashing us to do from birth.Instead of
applying self-knowlege,self-disipline,delayed gratification and hard work,we simply consume a product.
Many pedestrians have been maimed or killed at the intersection of Resistance and Commerce.

----
> Doctors estimate that seventy to eighty percent of their business is non-health-related.Peole aren't sick,they're
self-dramatizing.

> Casting yourself as a victim is the antithesis of doing your work.Don't do it .If you're doing it.Stop.

> Well,you think you're so clever and classless and free.Buy you're all fucking peasants as far as I can see.

> We know what the clan is; We know how to fit into the band and the tribe.What we don't know is how to be alone.We don't
know how to be free individuals.

> If you find yourself criticizing other people,you're probably doing it out of Resistance.When we see others begining to
live their authentic selves,it drives us crazy if we have not lived out our own.

> If you find yourself asking youself(and your friends),"Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?" Chances are you
are.

> Fear is good.Like self-doubt,fear is an indicator.Fear tells us what we have to do.

> Remember our rule of thumb: The more scared we are of a working or calling,the more sure we acn be that we have to do
it.

> Friends sometimes ask: "don't you get lonely sitting by yourself all day?" At first it seemed oddd to hear myself anwser
No. Then I realized that I was not alone; I was in the book; I was with the characters. I was with my self.

> Not only do I not feel alone with my characters;they are more vivid and interesting to me thatn the people in my real
life.

> What are we trying to heal,anyway? The athelete knows the day will never come when he wakes up pain-free.He has to play
hurt.

> Resistance loves 'healing'.Resistance knows that the more psychic energy we expend dredging and re-dredging the
tried,boring injustices of our personal lives,the less juice we have to our work.

> Seeking support from friends and family is like having your people gathered around at your deathbed.It's nice,but when
the ship sails,all they can do is stand on the docks waving goodbye.

> Don't knock rationalization.Where would we be without it? I don't know anyone who can through the day without two or
three juicy rationalizations.They're more important than sex.

> Defeating Resistance is like giving birth. It seems absolutely impossible until you remember that women have been
pulling it off successfully,with support and without,for fifty million years.

> It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior's life.

In my view,the amateur does not love the game enough.If he did,he would not pursue it as a sideline,distince from his
'real' vocation.

> The professional loves it so much he dedicates his life to it.He commits full-time.

Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspirationl."I wirte only when
inspiration strikes,"he replied."Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp." In terms of
Resistance,Maugham was saying,"I despise Resistance;I will not let if faze me; I will sit donw and do my work." Maugham
reckoned another,deeper truth: that by perfroming the mundane physical act of sitting down and starting to work,he set
in motion a mysterious but infalliable sequence of events that would produce inspiration,as surely as if the goddess had
synchronized her watch with his. He knew if he built it,she would come.

> I afford it the utmost respect,because I know it can defeat me on any given day as easily as the need for a drink can
overcome an alcoholic

An hour passes.I'm warmer now, the pace has got my blood going.The years have taught me one skill:how to be miserable.I
know how to shut up and keep humping. This is great asset because it's human,the proper role for a mortal.

The Marine Corps teaches you how to be miserable.This is invaluable for an artist.Marines love to be miserable.Marines
derive a perverse satisfaction from having colder chow,crappier equipment,and higher casualty rates than any outfit of
dogfaces,swab jockeys or flyboys,all of whom they despise.Why? Because these candy-asses don't know how to be miserable

> He has to know how to be miserable. He has to love being miserable.He has to take pride in being more miserable than any
soldier or swabbie or jet jockey.Because this is war,baby.And war is hell.

 Here I was,forty-two years old,divorced,childless,having given up all normal human pursuits to chase the dream of being
a writer;now I've finally got my name on a big-time Hollywood production starring Linda Hamilton,and what happend?I'm a 
loser,a phony;my life is worthless,and so am I.My friend Tony Keppelman snapped me out of it by asking if I was gonna
quit.Hell,no!"Then be happy.You're where you wanted to be,aren't you? So you're taking a few blows.That's the price for
being in the arena and not on the sidelines.Stop complaining and be grateful."

> Resistance gets us to plunge into a project with ano overambitious and unrealistic timetable for its completion.It knows
we can't sustain that level of intensity.We will hit the wall.We will crash.

> He knows that any job,whether it's a novel or a kitch romodel,takes twice as long as he thinks and costs twice as much.

> The professional steels himself at the start of a project,reminding himself it is the Iditarod,not the sixty-yard
dash.He conserves his energy.He prepare his mind for the long haul. He sustains himself with the knowledge that if he
can just keep those huskies mushing, sooner or later the sled will pull in to Nome.


> The profession shuts up. She doesn't talk about it. She does her work. The amateur belives he must first overcome his
fea;then he can do his work. The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. He knows there is no such thing as
a fearless warrior or a dread-free artist.


> The professional prepares mentally to absorb blows and to deliver them. His aim is take what the day gives him. He is
prepared to be prudent and prepared to be reckless, to take a beating when he has to, and to go for the throat when he
can. He understand that the field alters every day. His goal is not victory (success will come by itself when it wants
to) but to handle himself, his insides, as sturdily and steadily as he can.


> The professional cannot take rejection personally because to do so reinforces Resistance.Editor and not enemy;critics
are not the enemy.Resistance is the enemy.The battle is inside our own heads.We cannot let external criticism, even if
it's true, fortify our internal foe. 

All the warrior can give is his life; all the athlete can do is leave everything on the field.

> I had been in Tinaseltown five years, had finished nine screenplays on spec, none of which had sold. Finally I got a
meeting with a big producer. He kept taking phone calls, even as I pitched my stuff. He had one of those headset things,
so he didn't even have to pick up a receiver; the calls came in and he took them. Finally one came that was personal.
"would you mind?" he asked, indicating the door. "I need some privacy on this one." I exited. The door closed behind me.
Ten minutes passed. I was standing out by the secretaries. Twenty more minutes passed. Finally the producer's door
opened; he came out pulling on his jacket. "Oh, I'm so sorry!"

> He had forgotten all about me.

> I'm human. This hurt. I wasn't a kid either; I was in my forties, with a rap sheet of failure as long as your arm.


The professional keeps his eye on the doughnut and not on the hole. He reminds himself it's better to be in the arena,
getting stomped by the bull, than to be up in the stands or out in the parking lot.


> She gets an agent, she gets a lawyer, she gets an accountant. She knows she can only be a professional at one thing. She
brings in other pros and treats them with respect.


Most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters excepts sitting down every day and trying.

Why is this so important?

Because when we sit down day after day and keep grinding, something mysterious starts to happen. A process is set into
motion by which, inevitably and infallibly, heaven comes to our aid. Unseen forces enlist in our cause; serendipity
reinforces our purpose.


> We're facing dragons too. Fire-breathing griffins of the sould, whom we must outfight and outwit to reach the tresure of
our self-in-potential and to release the maiden who is God's plan and destiny for ourselves and the answer to why we
were put on this planet.


> The last thing I do before I sit down to work is say my prayer to the Muse. I say it out loud, in absolute earnest. Only
then I get down to business.


In my little house I had no TV. I never read a newspaper or went to a movie. I just work.


THE END.

> I never did find a buyer for the book. Or the next one, either. It was ten years before I got the first check for
something I had written and ten more before a novel, _The legen of Bagger Vance_, was actully published. But that moment
when I first hit the keys to spell out THE END was epochal. I remember rolling the last page out and adding it to the
stack that was the finished manuscript. Nobody knew I was done. Nobody cared. But I knew. I felt like a dragon I'd been
fighting all my life had just dropped deal at my feet and gasped out its last sulfuric breath.

> Rest in peace, motherfucker.

> Next morning I went over to Paul's for coffee and told him I had finished. "Good for you," he said without looking up.
"Start the next one today."



Eternity is in love with the creation of time. -- William Blake.


> Concerning all acts of initiative(and creation) there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless
ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too. All sorts of things
occur to help one that would not otherwise have occured. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, rasing in
one's favour all manner of unforeseen incidents and mettings and material assistance which mo man would have dream would
come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goeth's couplets:

#####"Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it. Begin it now." -- W.H.Murray.


> Angels work for God. It's their job to help us. Wake us up. Bump us along. Angels are agents of evolution. 

> Angels are like Muses. They know stuff we don't. They want to help us. They're on the other side of a pane of glass,
shouting to get our attention. But we can't hear them. We're too distracted by our own nonsense.

> Ah, but when we begin.

> when we make a start.

> when we conceive an enterprise and commit to it in the face of our fears, something wonderful happens. A crack appears
in the membrane. Like the first craze when a chick pecks at the inside of its shell. Angel midwives congregate around
us; they assist as we give birth to ourselves, to that person we were born to be, to the one whose destiny was encoded
in our soul, our daimon, our genius.


> I was sitting cross-legged when an eagle came and landed on my shoulders. The eagle merged with me and took off flying,
so that my head became its head and my arms its wings.


> Miraculously, cancers go into remission. People recover. Is it possible, Tom Laughlin asks, that the disease itself
evolved as a consequence of actions taken(or not taken) in our lives? Could our unlived lives have exacted their
vengeance upon us in the form of cancer? And if they did, can we cure ourselves, now, by living these lives out?


> What is the Ego, anyway? Since this is my book, I'll define it my way. The Ego is that part of psyche that believes in
the material existence. The Ego's job is to take care of business in the real world. It's an important job. We couldn't
last a day without it. But there are worlds other than real world, and this is where Ego runs into trouble.

> Here's what the Ego belives: 
1. Death is real. The Ego belives that our existence is defined by our physical flesh. When the body dies, we die. There
is no life beyond life.
2. Time and space are real. The Ego is analog. It believes that to get from A to Z we have to pass through B,C,and D. To
get from breakfast to supper we have to live the whole day.
3. " Every individual is different and separate from every other. The Ego believes that I am distinct from you. The twain
cannot meet. I can hurt you and it won't me. "
4. "There is no God. No sphere exist except that phsyical and no rules apply except those of the material world. "

> Here's what Self belives:
1. Death is an illusion. The soul endures and evolves through infinite manifestations.
2. Time and space are illusions. Time and space operate only in the physical sphere, and even here, don't apply to
dreams, vision, transports. In other dimensions we move "swift as thought" and inhabit mutilple planes simultaneously.
3. All beings are one. If I hurt you, I hurt myself.
4. The supreme emotion is love. Union and mutual assistance are the imperatives of life. We are all in this together.
5. God is all there is. Everything that is, is God in one form or another. God, the divine ground, is that in which we
live and move and have our being. Infinite planes of reality exist, all created by, sustained by and infused by the
sprit of God.



We fear discovering that we are more than we think we are. More than our parents/children/teahcers think we are. We fear
that we actually possess the talent that our still, small voice tells us. That we actually have the guts, the
perseverance, the capacity. We fear that we truly can steer our own ship, plant our flag, reach out Promised Land. We
fear this because, if it's true, than we become estranged from all we know. We pass through a membrane. We become
monsters and monstrous.


> Do you have kids?

> Then you know that not one of them poped out as tabula rasa, a blank
slate. each came into this world with distinct and unique personality,
and identity so set that you can fling stardust and great balls of fire
and not morph it by ine micro-dot.


> Personally I'm with Wordsworth:    
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: The soul that rises with us, our life's star, Hath had elsewhere its setting,
And cometh from afar: Not in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing clouds of glory do we come,
From God who is our home. 

 In other words, none of us are born as passive generic blobs waiting for the world to stamp its imprint on us. Instead
we show up possessing already a highly refined and individuated soul.

> Our job in this lifetime is not shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we
already are and become it.


> The artist cannot look to others to validates his efforts or his callings. If you don't believe me, ask Van Gogh, who
produced masterpiece after masterpiece and never found a buyer in his whole life.


> The art of creation is by definition territorial. As the mother-to-be bears her child within her, so the artist or
innovator contains her new life. No one can help her give it birth. But neither does she need any help.

> The new mom weeps in awe at the little miracle in her arms. She knows it came out of her but not from her, through her
but not of her.


If we were the last person on earth, would we still show up at the studio, the reheasal hall, the laboratory?


Give the act to me. Purged of hope and ego, Fix your attention on the soul, Act and do for me.




> If you were meant to cure cancer or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don't do it, you not only hurt
yourself, even destroy yourself. You hurt your children. You hurt me. Your hurt the planet.

> You shame the angels who watch over you and you spite the Almighty, who created you and only you with your unique gifts,
for the sole purpose of nudging the human race one millimeter fater along its path back to God.

> Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It's a gift to the world and
every being in it. Don't cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you've got.
