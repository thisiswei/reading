### New Programmer's survival manual 

------------------------------------

######most important concept i receive is :

* you must beat you code like a mutherfukcer before it get out of your door

The Rspec Book already mentioned twice (i'll check [it](http://www.amazon.com/The-RSpec-Book-Behaviour-Development/dp/1934356379/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1353867587&sr=8-1&keywords=Rspec) out) 


> simplest way to assure code quality is to have another programmer read
it 

----------

######Acceptance Tests:
*when you got to withdraw money when the balance is 0, the screen print
out "what?You want some of this,bitch !"

### Practices VS Mind-Set ----commit to solid code
> Testing gives you tool for both design and rigor at the same time.


> writing good test,just like writing good application,require
though,diligence,and good judgment.

 ######books mentioned: 
 * kent backs's Test-Driven-Development
 * The Rspec Book
 * kim Bruce's Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages
 * Growing Object-Oriented Software,Guided by test

 ###### practices I can do :
 * write a program that read lines of comma-separated data from a
 file,splits them apart,and use them to create object

 * parse Xml file and save it.
   > It is very common task in industry,so it's useful to
   practice with loading and saving XML

   what happens when there are no item in the list?
   a blank field
   invalid characters
 
 > build some test for manipulating the customer list and save it back
 to file, you can use Builder for ruby
 

 ### start coding as soon as possible -- do it wrong first
>  I argue that whatever decision you make up front will be wrong  --
Scott 'Zz' Zimmerman

>  when I'm programming, I make a prototype with just a few big
classes,Then i write production code once i have a better piture of the
problem --- Scott 'Zz'

#### neccesary and accidental complexity
> the better opposite of complexity is clear (not simple)
> dig through you  project you working on and identify places where the
code could be clearer if that logic was abstracted into its own module

###### Line of Code is meature of weight,not progress
