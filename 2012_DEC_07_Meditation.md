### Meditation

----

> I learned to relish the beauty of manners, and to restrain all anger.
> I learned to be religious, and liberal; and to guard, not only against
> evil actions, but even against any evil intention's entering my
> thoughts;
> 
> He who had the charge of education, taught me not to be fondly attached
> to any of the contending parties in the chariot-races, or in the
> combats of the gladiators. He taught me also to endure labour; not to
> need many things, to serve myself, without troubling others; not to
> intermeddle with the affairs of others, and not easily to admit of
> accusations against them. Of Diognetus; not to busy myself about vain
> things.
> 
> 
> always to remain the same man, whether in the sharpest pains, or after
> the loss of a child, or in long diseases.
> 
> 
> not to be offended with the ignorant, or with those who follow the
> vulgar opinions without examination.
> 
> 
> He taught me by his example, to supress even the least apprearance of
> anger, of any other passions;
> 
> 
> always to hope the best; and to be unsuspicious about the affections of
> my friends.
> 
----
> 
> I cannot be angry at my kinsmen, or hate them. We were formed by
> nature for mutual assistance, as the two feet, the hands, the eyelids,
> the upper and lower rows of the teeth.Opposition to each other is
> contrary to nature: All anger and aversion is an opposition.
> 
> 
> Remember how long you have put off these things; and how often you have
> neglected to use the opportunity offered you by the Gods. 
> 
> 
> Wander no more to and ro; and guard also against this other wandering
> 
> 
> For the angry man seems to be turned from right reson, by a sort of pain
> and contraction sezing him unwares. But he who sins from lust, conquer'd
> by pleasure, seems more dissolute, weak, and effeminate in his vices.
> 
> 
> If thou should live three thousand years, or as many myriads, yet
> remember this, that no man loses any other life that he now lives;and
> that he now lives no other life thatn what he is parting with, every
> instant. The longest life, and the shortest, come to one effect: since
> the present time is equal to all, what is lost or parted with is equal
> to all.And for the same reason, what is parted with, is only a moment.
> No man at death parts with, or, is deprived of, what is either past or
> future.
> 
> 
> Again that the longest and the shortest lives have an equal loss at
> death. The present moment is all which either is deprived of, since that
> all he has. A man cannot part with what he has not.
> 
> 
> 
> To sum up all, the body, and all things related to it, are like a river;
> what belongs to the animal life, is a dream, and smoak; life a warfare,
> and a journey in a strange land; surviving fame is but oblivion.
> 
> 
----
> 
> we should, therefore, make haste, not only because death is
> everyday so much nearer, but because the power of considering well
> and understanding things, often leaves us before death.                                                                        
> 
> 
> Never value that as advantageous, which may force you to break you
> faith; to quit you modesty, or sense of honour; to hate, suspect, or
> imprecate evil on any one; to dissemble; or to desire any of these
> things which need walls or curtains to conceal them.He who to all things
> prefers the soul, the divinity within him, and the sacred mysteries of
> its virtues, makes no tragical exclamations,complaints,or groans. He
> needs neigher solitude nor a cround; and, what is greatest of all, he
> lives without either desires or fear of death.
> 
> 
> Quit,therefore,other things,and retain these few. Remember also that
> each man lives only the present moment: the rest of time is either spend
> and gone, or is quite unknown. It is a very little time which each man
> lives, and in a small corner of the earth; and the longest surviving
> fame is but short, and this conveyed through a succession of poor
> mortals, each presnetly a-dying; men who neither knew themselves, nor
> the persons long since dead.
> 
> 
> Let nothing be done at random,but according to the complete rules of
> art.

##### They seek retirements in the country, on the sea-coasts, or mountains:  you too used to be fond of such things. But this is all from ignorance.   A man may any hor he pleases retire into himself; and no where will he  find a place of more quiet and leisure than his own soul: especially if  he has that furniture within, the view of which immediately gives him  the fullest tranquility. By tranquility, I mean the most graceful order.   Allow yourself continually this retirement, and refresh and renew  yourself.

> Remove "I am hurt," and you remove the harm.

> Time is a river, or violent torrent of things coming into being; each

> Whatever happens,is a natural, and customary,and known, as a rose in the

> I walk on in the path which is according to nature, till I fall down to
> rest, breating out my last breath into that air I daily drew in,falling
> into that earth whence my father derived his seeds,my mother her blood,
> my nurse her milk for my nourishment; that earth which supplied me for
> so many years with meat and drink, and bears me walking on it, and so
> amny ways abusing it.

> you are of the object of universal fate, or providence.

> 
> Presently you shall be only ashes and dry bones, and a name; or,
> perhaps, not even a name. A name is but certain noise or sound, or echo.
> The things most honoured in life are but vain, rotten, mean;

-

> If this event be neither any vice of mine, nor any action from any
> vitious disposition of mine, nor be hurtful to the whole, why am I
> disturbed by it. Nay, who can hurt the whole?

> What strange conduct is this! Some men cannot speak good word of their
> contemporaries,with whom they live; and yet are very solicitous, about
> gaining the praises of posterity, who they never saw.


##### If any thing seems exceedingly diffcult for you to accomplish, don't conclude it to be impossible to all men; but rather, if you see any thing possible to man, and a part of his proper work, conclude that you also may attain to it.


- 

Remember how he never quit any subject,till he had thoroughly examined
it, and understood it; and how he bore those who accused him unjustly,
without making any angry returns; how he was ever calm without hurry;


#####Awake, and call yourself up; and, as you see, when you are fully roused,that these were but dream which disturbed you;

- 
what is not the interest of hive, is not the interest of bee.


How many of those who entered the world along with me, are gone off
before me?
