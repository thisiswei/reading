#### Bird by Bird

#####Every morning, no matter how late he had been up, my father rose at 5:30, went to his study, wrote for a couple of hours, made us all breakfast, read the paper with my mother, and then back to work for the rest of the morning.

> All of this made me start wanting to be a writer When I grew up -- to be
artistic, a free spirit, and yet also to be the rare working-class
person in charge of their own life.

" I walked to the lip of the water and let the foamy tongue of the
rushing liquid lick my toes. A sand crab burrowed a hole a few inches
from my foot and then disappear into the damp sand...."


> Yet the people on our peninsula were second only to the Native Americans
in the slums of Oakland in the rate of alcoholism, and the drug abuse
among teenagers was, as my father wrote, soul chilling, and there was
rampant divorce and mental breakdown and wayward sexual behavior.


" for a life oriented to leisure is the end a life oriented to death --
the greatest leisure of all. "


> I devoured books like a person taking vitamins, afraid that otherwise I
would remain this gelatinous narcissist, with no possibility of ever
becoming thoughtful, of ever being taken seriously.


" Do it everyday for a while," my father kept saying. "Do it as you
would do scales on the piano. Do it by prearrangement with yourself. Do
it as a debt of honor. And make a commiment to finishing things."

> I wrote every night for an hour or more, often in coffeehouses with a
notepad and my pen, drinking great quantities of wine because this is
what writers do; this was what my father and all his friends did. It
worked for them, although there was now a new and disturbing trend --
they had started committing suicide. This was very paintful for my
father, of course. But we both kept writing.

##### It reminds me of "The Wild Rose," a poem Wendell Berry wrote for his wife: _sometimes hidden from me in the daily custom and in trust, so that I live by you unawre as by the beating of my heart, suddenly you flare in my sight, a wild rose blooming at the edge of thicket, grace and light where yesterday was only shade, and once again I am blessed, choosing again what I chose before._

##### E.L.Doctorow once said that "writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way." You don't have to see where you're going. you don't have to see your destination or everything you will pass along the way. You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you. This is right up there with the best advice about writing, or life, I have ever heard.
